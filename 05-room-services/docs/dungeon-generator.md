## Additional Prompt Instructions
To generate more unique combinations, you can add these instructions to your prompt:

```
Additional requirements:
1. Combine at least one physical descriptor with one atmospheric descriptor
2. Mix elements from different theme categories
3. Avoid common combinations (like "Dark Dungeon" or "Ancient Temple")
4. Consider the room's purpose and environment within the larger dungeon
5. Add unexpected but thematically appropriate elements

Optional: Include a brief description of what might be found in the room.
```

## Example Outputs
Here are some example outputs using these components:

1. "The Crystalline Workshop of Frozen Time"
   - A massive chamber where magical artifacts are crafted, suspended in temporal ice

2. "Weeping Gardens of Moonlit Bones"
   - An overgrown courtyard where skeletal remains serve as macabre planters

3. "Ethereal Library of Whispered Prophecies"
   - Ancient tomes float in the air, their pages turning by unseen hands

4. "Moldering Treasury of Forgotten Kings"
   - A vault filled with cursed riches and the remnants of fallen dynasties

5. "Sanctified Forge of Dawn's Hope"
   - A divine smithy where holy weapons are blessed by morning light

## Tips for Implementation
1. Allow for random combination of elements from different categories
2. Implement weighted randomization to favor more coherent combinations
3. Add context-specific word lists based on your dungeon's theme
4. Consider adding location-specific descriptors based on dungeon level or area
5. Include optional suffixes or prefixes for additional variety
